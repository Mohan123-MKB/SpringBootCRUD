# 👩‍🏫 Teacher Management System

Welcome to the **Teacher Management System** – a backend web application developed using **Spring Boot** and **MySQL**. 
This project is designed to perform full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on teacher records through a RESTful API.
It serves as a practical implementation of building scalable, layered backend architecture using real-world entities, and is ideal for learning how to work with REST APIs, Spring Data JPA, service layers, and MySQL integration.
Whether you are building an internal admin tool for schools, colleges, or training centers – this project lays a solid foundation to manage teacher data effectively.
